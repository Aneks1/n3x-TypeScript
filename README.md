Ok, so i already made a [repository](https://github.com/ItsAmex/n3x) for n3x, but I see a lot of Discord Bots coded in JavaScript, but really, I have never seen a good bot with TypeScript before (it doesn't mean they don't exist), so here it is, n3x.

## Features :D

• Moderation Commands

• "FORDIBBEN-WORD-LIST"

• Leveling System

• Custom Prefix

• Hey, I won't say you anything else, check the code and discover other features by yourself!

This bot was created for my Discord Server, but you can always use it as a template, change prefix, change the amount of gained xp, the allowed channels, yea, you know.
